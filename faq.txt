CATEGORY: PRODUCTS & INGREDIENTS 🧴
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What ingredients do you use in your soaps?
A: We use only natural, high-quality ingredients including cold pressed oils (olive,
coconut, palm), shea butter, essential oils, natural colorants from herbs and
clays, and distilled water.

Q: Are your products vegan?
A: Most of our soaps are vegan-friendly. The Honey Oat soap contains honey which
is not suitable for vegans. All other products in our range are 100% plant-based.
Please check individual product descriptions or contact us if you have specific
concerns.

Q: Are your soaps safe for sensitive skin?
A: Yes! Our soaps are gentle and free from harsh chemicals, making them suitable
for most sensitive skin types. We recommend our Aloe Vera Bliss and Honey Oat
soaps for sensitive skin. However, if you have specific allergies, please check
the ingredients list or do a patch test first.

Q: How long do your soaps last?
A: With regular daily use, our soaps typically last 4-6 weeks. To maximize the
life of your soap, keep it dry between uses by using a draining soap dish and
storing it away from direct water spray. Unopened soaps have a shelf life of
about 12 months.

Q: Do you test on animals?
A: Absolutely not! Bint-e-Samin Soaps is 100% cruelty-free. We never test our
products on animals, and we only use ingredients from suppliers who share our
commitment to ethical practices.
